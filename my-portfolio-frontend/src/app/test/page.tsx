// This is a test page to verify the layout file in the Next.js application. It should be placed in the `app/test` directory.
// The page will be rendered when the user navigates to `/test` in the application.
// The purpose of this page is to ensure that the layout file is correctly applied to all pages in the application.
// The layout file is responsible for defining the overall structure and styling of the application, including the header, footer, and any other common elements that should be present on every page.
// By creating this test page, we can confirm that the layout file is functioning as expected and that all pages in the application are styled consistently. This is important for maintaining a cohesive user experience and ensuring that the application looks and feels professional.
//
// In addition to verifying the layout file, this test page can also be used to test other aspects of the application, such as routing and navigation. By adding links to other pages in the application, we can ensure that users can easily navigate between different sections of the site and that all links are functioning correctly.
// This is especially important for larger applications with multiple pages and sections, as it can be easy to overlook small details that can impact the user experience. By testing the layout file and navigation on this test page, we can ensure that the application is fully functional and ready for use by our users.
// Overall, this test page serves as a valuable tool for verifying the layout file and ensuring that the application is functioning correctly. By taking the time to test these elements, we can create a better user experience and ensure that our application is ready for use by our users.
